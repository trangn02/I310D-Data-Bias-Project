This difference in the correct identification of hate comments based on swear words leads me to think that there is a bias in Perspective API that targets comments with swear words, therefore also being able to better identify hate comments with swear words. This may become problematic as a creative commenter can leave a toxic comment but has a better chance to avoid being flagged if they can word their comment without swear words and or be creative with censoring.\n",

        "In conclusion, I believe that the model needs and would extremely benefit from more training in detecting hate comments that do not contain swear words. I learned a lot throughout the process of this assignment, especially more about interacting with models and using API's. It was interesting to be able to interact with an API like this using comments that I made myself for the purpose of it and I found this to be a valuable experience. However, this raised the question to me about how these models are trained, and more specifically, how their training data is being chosen. Is it possible to suggest a dataset for the API to use to train? What standards do developers abide by to create training sets? This project also led me to think about other existing biases that may be present in Perspective API, such as contextual bias. Contextual bias and things like detecting sarcasm sound like a difficult task for a machine learning model, and I am interested in how these biases are currently being mitigated. Overall, I found this project to be a good learning and exploratory experience."
